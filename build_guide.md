# BabyBelt Pro V2 Build Guide
BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink

Written by Brent Lieb and Mason McNair of the Plants X Tech Lab at Michigan State University
## Introduction
Hello! This is the build guide for the BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink. This guide was written with new builders in mind, so don't be intimidated if this is your first printer! The guide includes images when possible and assumes the user is building from the {Fabreeko build kit w/ link?}. 

Throughout this build guide *Printed Parts* will me in italics and **Kit Parts** will be bolded. ${\color{lightgreen}Tools}$ that you need will be listed in ${\color{lightgreen}green}$ at the top of each section. ${\color{red}Parts}$ that you need to buy separately will be in ${\color{red}red}$.

>[!TIP] 
>If you are not familiar with 3D Printers and their components, it is recommended that you leave the parts from the kit in their packaging until the guide instructs you to unpack them. This will help you keep track of them and avoid confusion later.

## Printed Parts
### Printing Parts
Most of the parts of this kit can be printed out of normal PLA, allowing for a wide range of colors and stylistic choices! The parts that shouldn't be printed out of PLA are listed below. 

- Nema17-Zgear
- Roller-ZGear
- Underbed

The printer that was built for this guide was made using [Timberfill](https://fillamentum.com/collections/timberfill-filament/) as the main filament, [Marble PLA](https://us.polymaker.com/products/panchroma-marble?variant=43612877946937) for an accent color, and [PolyMide PA6-GF](https://us.polymaker.com/products/fiberon-pa6-gf25) for the components that couldn't be printed out of PLA.
