# BabyBelt Pro V2 Build Guide
BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink

Written by Brent Lieb and Mason McNair of the Plants X Tech Lab at Michigan State University
## Introduction
Hello! This is the build guide for the BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink. This guide was written with new builders in mind, so don't be intimidated if this is your first printer! The guide includes images when possible and assumes the user is building from the {Fabreeko build kit w/ link?}. 

Throughout this build guide *Printed Parts* will me in italics and **Kit Parts** will be bolded. ${\color{lightgreen}Tools}$ that you need will be listed in ${\color{lightgreen}green}$ at the top of each section. ${\color{red}Parts}$ that you need to buy separately will be in ${\color{red}red}$.

>[!TIP] 
>If you are not familiar with 3D Printers and their components, it is recommended that you leave the parts from the kit in their packaging until the guide instructs you to unpack them. This will help you keep track of them and avoid confusion later. 
## Tools Needed 
- Tool 1
- Tool 2
## Printed Parts
### Printing Parts
Most of the parts of this kit can be printed out of normal PLA, allowing for a wide range of colors and stylistic choices! The parts that shouldn't be printed out of PLA are listed below. 

- Nema17-Zgear
- Roller-ZGear
- Underbed

The printer that was built for this guide was made using [Timberfill](https://fillamentum.com/collections/timberfill-filament/) as the main filament, [Marble PLA](https://us.polymaker.com/products/panchroma-marble?variant=43612877946937) for an accent color, and [PolyMide PA6-GF](https://us.polymaker.com/products/fiberon-pa6-gf25) for the components that couldn't be printed out of PLA.

>[!NOTE]
>If you are using a Revo nozzle and not the Bamboo nozzle that comes with the Fabreeko kit, then the gantry-carriage parts will be slightly different. 
## Kit Parts
This is what the box will look like when you receive it.

## Physical Build
### Base
The build is going to start with constructing the base. First, place an M3 Nut into the hole indicated by the arrow. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f66063c8-3008-409c-8f27-009faf8ccdbe" width="600"/>

Then join the two sides together and place a M3x20 screw into the indicated hole and tighten. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e73aca-53a8-43ac-a976-e8c8e7b76029" width="600"/>

The base should now look like this.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/678ede30-ba2e-42d9-becf-548105bb3d0a" width="600"/>

### Rollers
The rollers will be assembled by placing a M8 Nut into the side slot and then inserting a M8x70 Hex Screw with a 608ZZ bearing fully into the roller.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/47f892c2-268e-4fd6-a17c-4b0a0a33c899" width="600"/>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b7fe5e2-fc3a-438e-8e10-b344fc9bd093" width="600"/>

On one of the rollers, one end will also have the rollerZGear on the screw, before the bearing.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/27be182f-58d0-4060-87bc-f9150ab8fc27" width="600"/>

Both rollers should be wrapped in electrical tape to maintain a better grip on the belt. I recommend 2 wraps, with the 2nd one helping to hold the first in place.

### Y Stop
The idler holder should be inserted into the idler body with the larger hole (to accomodate for the screw head) on the same side as the circular indentation on the body. Make sure your orientation matches the following pictures.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7af55c58-0bbf-41a4-b603-e724bc4c4f4e" width="600"/>

>[!CAUTION]
>Make sure the configuration of your idler holder and body are correct before proceeding.

### Gantry Carriage
The Gantry Carriage starts with attaching the fanmount to the wire and belt holder. Inert 2 M3x10 Hex Screws into the holes indicated in the first image, and through the whole in the second image, secure with M3 Nuts. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983b2477-9dfa-4432-8ae9-50a352528a17" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0addedb7-bd45-4dc7-86bf-5a80da0c1dbf" width="600"/>

Your part should now look like this. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e161cee9-e5ef-45d4-b6f4-c7a81139aa65" width="600"/>

Orient the fan so that the air flow will move towards the air duct on the fan mount, then secure where indicated with zip ties. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d54245d-0a52-4fe1-b681-3d7750e7941d" width="600"/>

Use a zip tie to secure the wires to the side of the component. 

### X Gantry
Start off building the X Gantry by lining up the idlers with the indicated holes and securing in place with 2 M3x20 Hex Screws.
<img src="(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e96993ae-0902-4b96-b806-d7710f0146ad" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/514bbd8f-24d2-4797-9810-8d411b986082" width="600"/>

Your gantry should now look like this. The yellow boxes indicated where the gantry will be attached to a pair of linear rails. You will need 8 M2x6 Hex Screws in total, 4 for each linear rail. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce6b942d-3be2-42fb-a343-3d55f489169e" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af106214-e4c4-4e9e-b750-12450851296f" width="600"/>

Here's what it should look like with the rails attached.
