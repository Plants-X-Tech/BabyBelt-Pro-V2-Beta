# BabyBelt Pro V2 Build Guide
BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink

Written by Brent Lieb and Mason McNair of the Plants X Tech Lab at Michigan State University
## Introduction
Hello! This is the build guide for the BabyBelt Pro V2 by RobMink. This guide was written with new builders in mind, so don't be intimidated if this is your first printer! The guide includes images when possible and assumes the user is building from the {Fabreeko build kit w/ link?}. 

Throughout this build guide *Printed Parts* will me in italics and **Kit Parts** will be bolded. ${\color{lightgreen}Tools}$ that you need will be listed in ${\color{lightgreen}green}$ at the top of each section. ${\color{red}Parts}$ that you need to buy separately will be in ${\color{red}red}$.

>[!TIP] 
>If you are not familiar with 3D Printers and their components, it is recommended that you leave the parts from the kit in their packaging until the guide instructs you to unpack them. This will help you keep track of them and avoid confusion later. 
## Tools Needed 
- Tool 1
- Tool 2
## Printed Parts
### Printing Parts
Most of the parts of this kit can be printed out of normal PLA, allowing for a wide range of colors and stylistic choices! The parts that shouldn't be printed out of PLA are listed below. 

- Nema17-Zgear
- Roller-ZGear
- Underbed

The printer that was built for this guide was made using [Timberfill](https://fillamentum.com/collections/timberfill-filament/) as the main filament, [Marble PLA](https://us.polymaker.com/products/panchroma-marble?variant=43612877946937) for an accent color, and [PolyMide PA6-GF](https://us.polymaker.com/products/fiberon-pa6-gf25) for the components that couldn't be printed out of PLA.

## Physical Build
>[!NOTE]
>There are several times during this build when a component will be secured with multiple screws. It is generally recommended to NOT fully tighten a screw before the rest have been started, to make sure parts line up correctly and don't crack. 
### Base
The build is going to start with constructing the base. First, place an M3 Nut into the hole indicated by the arrow. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f66063c8-3008-409c-8f27-009faf8ccdbe" width="600"/>

Then join the two sides together and place a M3x20 screw into the indicated hole and tighten. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60e73aca-53a8-43ac-a976-e8c8e7b76029" width="600"/>

The base should now look like this.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/678ede30-ba2e-42d9-becf-548105bb3d0a" width="600"/>

### Power Switch and Jack
Now it's time to install the power jack and switch. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eab798bf-1eee-4daf-8fb8-a4f408d694df" width="400"/>

There will be two circular holes right next to each other on the side of the printer. The black rubber cover for the power jack is optional. The power jack will need to be secured with a nut, while the power switch will simply lock into place once pushed in.  (check which part letter)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d6d6a31-7caf-4dcb-abdb-f1ed99514283" width="400"/>

Here is what it should look like from the other side. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77bac97a-cb90-4558-a4f0-0e4bb4c02942" width="400"/>

Wire the two components as such. Wrap in electrical tape if desired. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4c4e5fe0-e58a-4b74-9332-37aeebc78053" width="400"/>

### Board
Install the board by the power switch using 3 (insert screw type)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b7ecfd8f-f5dd-46bf-8269-dbd4b9b66b3b" width="500"/>

Make sure the USB-C and MicroSD ports both line up with the holes for them in the side panel. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7149403c-ffb8-4952-a30e-437616d1a554" width="400"/>

Connect the wires from the power switch & jack to the power (whatever that connector is called) on the board (look to the lower right on the first picture, the once facing differently from the rest. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/341a8c70-fc60-44ff-981f-8a9f0b21cab1" width="400"/>

Here is what it should look like. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a796f87f-1ac0-43b1-a7ee-fe7631c2516e" width="400"/>

### Screen
Next we can install the screen.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7d2010a1-e6ee-433a-97a6-2b42b1cd4d0b" width="500"/>

Use 4 M3x10mm to connect the screen to the holder.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56344ad5-babf-43a7-845c-54267f22ab2f" width="500"/>

Here is what it should look like. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2c9b1930-8b4a-4e23-8fb0-0d9b97458b7b" width="500"/>

Now that the screen itself it mounted we can attach the knob and single wire needed for it. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af6e648e-cb76-47d7-8f44-9cd0f53df8f0" width="500"/>

The knob can simply be pushed onto the front of the screen. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fdc654fa-ed42-4689-9ce5-1be9e89d27ea" width="500"/>

Next we will plug the wire in, use the end that is combined by a single piece of plastic and plug it into the RS232 port. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f9ca34d8-1787-478c-8bad-1660cb3cc499" width="300"/>

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f32a3417-b41a-479b-ab4b-8d5fe66cb84c" width="300"/>

To attach the screen mount to the rest of the base, first you will need to insert a M3 Nut into the hole on the bottom of the frame, next to where it slots into the base. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/597d2b2c-b585-4c7a-b72e-251d67fccc63" width="500"/>

Insert a M3x20mm into the hole on the side of the frame and use it to secure the screen mount. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6d614dc-dff0-48c2-993d-31b4e22f030d" width="500"/>

Next use 2 M3x10mm screws and 2 M3 Nuts to attach the screen mount with the two holes in the top. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8f4b22a-0f02-4fcc-880c-143a53111aa4" width="500"/>

It should look like this when done. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/99af6369-9028-4598-8226-b3acdb63f3a0" width="500"/>

### Extruder
Attach the gear to the extruder motor as such. Make sure it properly fits with the rest of the gears in the extruder.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee6b4935-d054-41bc-b9f8-ac7f15953488" width="300"/>

Line up the motor with the mounting holes in the side of the frame. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bd6d13f7-7065-4890-9354-b8aff10cd5e3" width="300"/>

Attach the extruder to the outside of the frame and screw in with 4 M3x10mm screws to secure everything. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f627ea61-01b5-446b-9ed1-e5c02fc67d36" width="300"/>

### Belt Tensioner
Next we can build and install the belt tensioners. 
>[!NOTE]
>There are two of these, so do each step twice.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6457005-1cc5-4994-9dfa-080abeef1ef4" width="500"/>

The first step is to fit a M8 Nut into the (compenent name) and secure with a M8x70mm Screw. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df1fb383-9402-4468-b976-6a9a1a05ac0a" width="300"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e64ce2-4803-4124-9279-d7a819573305" width="500"/>

Next fit another nut into the (component name) and line up with the hole on the (component name).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e03702d-3aa5-464d-9c64-d415d65d8d85" width="500"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c240b288-dc5a-4636-8a0b-98f97797228d" width="400"/>

Your belt tensioners should look like this.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e39cf16a-80e4-4c52-b760-763699a63cf9" width="500"/>

There will be a spot for the tensioners to fit on either side of the base. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6782f3f2-decd-4a22-8f90-4d772b28c937" width="500"/>

Use a M3x20mm screw to install both of the tensioners with the curved portion facing downward. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7f2de77-f25e-4956-82bd-a4fd07d89f15" width="500"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed9512a5-8de4-4748-b3db-ba6e1fe0bee2" width="500"/>

### Rollers
Both rollers should be wrapped in electrical tape to maintain a better grip on the belt. I recommend 2 wraps, with the 2nd one helping to hold the first in place. 

The rollers will be assembled by placing a M8 Nut into the side slot and then inserting a M8x70 Hex Screw with a 608ZZ bearing fully into the roller.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e3aadef-e4c9-4dc8-8644-2361f7116dfd" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/17879f8c-5dbe-4347-8bf7-3feb78fd261c" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fc152093-dc8d-498b-9b91-96f2069aff33" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8a36d71-9002-4c6f-bf11-f0d818ad1f3c" width="600"/>


On one of the rollers, one end will also have the rollerZGear on the screw, before the bearing. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde2928-e1e8-4733-8c04-ffd2baae0da5" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4ae22e8-4ee6-4781-9b66-eb6a80ddd77b" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6513f526-5d7e-4cb6-b9b4-1e5cb766752e" width="600"/>

### Z Motor
Now we will install the Z motor.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0b40892e-217d-4f52-80b4-7c3ce20613d7" width="500"/>

This motor will be install just like the extruder motor, but without the extruder. Use 4 M3x10mm screws. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3fb7976c-f58f-4e95-9401-5e7e916cd272" width="500"/>

You will want to make sure the wire port on the motor is facing towards the screen. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7877d8de-6ce7-4902-9283-c2a2d269ba93" width="500"/>

Install the Nema 17 Z Gear onto the motor and then check to make sure it will line up with the gear on the Z roller. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c964e1b-c2df-4af8-b923-84f7bea368fb" width="250"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d71a185e-4428-4ba6-96d3-8a3b8c4009c8" width="500"/>

Improperly fitting vs Properly fitting gears

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4cbc0b8f-7f7b-4984-b562-efb14ed604ee" width="450"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/172ade7e-f9cf-4630-b455-d86e6c6c31c1" width="500"/>

Place a M3 Nut into the slot on the side of the base right above the motor. Repeat on the other side. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/230711e7-efb6-4479-b41e-3a5bc8a730e7" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/51d66fe4-46e7-4d7e-bfda-5b9f368a5c47" width="500"/>

Use a M3 Nut and M3x20mm screw to attach the scrapper like how the screen mount was attached previously. Use M3x10mm to attach the scrapper right below the roller, securing into the nuts we previously inserted. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0f8708d-9e75-4c7e-93d0-6078a2efaa76" width="500"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/050e85e9-5f11-4d8c-854d-8ba158d446f3" width="450"/>

>[!NOTE]
>To complete this guide, we decied to leave the belt off during this step to make it easier to get clear images of the build as it progressed. Even once the printer is built, removing the scrapper and replacing the belt is a trivial process. Since you are NOT creating the BabyBeltPro V2 Build Manual, install the Z roller with the belt so it looks like the picture on the right. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c7a9985-c82d-4b31-ace3-f78fa4ebd704" width="500"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2bb28c96-0a7e-42c5-a27f-0e4e4b368a42" width="375"/>

### Y Stop
The idler holder should be inserted into the idler body with the larger hole (to accomodate for the screw head) on the same side as the circular indentation on the body. Make sure your orientation matches the following pictures. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15919510-2bae-485b-913d-e8298204de60" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7af55c58-0bbf-41a4-b603-e724bc4c4f4e" width="400"/>

>[!CAUTION]
>Make sure the configuration of your idler holder and body are correct before proceeding.

### Hotend Fan
The Gantry Carriage starts with attaching the fanmount to the wire and belt holder. Inert 2 M3x10 Hex Screws into the holes indicated in the first image, and through the whole in the second image, secure with M3 Nuts. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/983b2477-9dfa-4432-8ae9-50a352528a17" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0addedb7-bd45-4dc7-86bf-5a80da0c1dbf" width="300"/>

Your part should now look like this. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e161cee9-e5ef-45d4-b6f4-c7a81139aa65" width="400"/>

Orient the fan so that the air flow will move towards the air duct on the fan mount, then secure where indicated with zip ties. 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d54245d-0a52-4fe1-b681-3d7750e7941d" width="400"/>

Use a zip tie to secure the wires to the side of the component. 

### Y Gantry
Insert a (nut) into the still exposed slot on the (component)

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14f45fcf-075b-46d2-b59d-07b6f31b1015" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca8fff81-89f2-453d-a82b-0f0ca9a63a19" width="400"/>

It should line up with the hotend fan like so, attach with (screws).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4ad4f308-e609-4841-a616-053420db988f" width="400"/>

Insert (nuts) into the slots indicated on the (component).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/690f6a91-35cc-4c6f-8a33-c25ede306f81" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/885f7aad-7a41-429c-9c85-67f06a6d4d6a" width="400"/> 

Next we will install the hotend to the (component).

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/043df1a4-8de6-4cf5-bd9d-c47bba7ad218" width="400"/>

 Use a (screw) and a (nut) to attach the hotend to the piece through the hole shown at the top of the (component). 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9245b2fb-d5c7-429b-b5fb-7d604090764f" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/125916a8-e388-4fca-99e6-374df99b4a23" width="400"/>

Make sure the screw goes through the correct hole on the hotend. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/566c6d64-adca-411f-997b-366c087e6e37" width="400"/>

Next insert (nuts) into the holes pictured

### Hotend
Next we will install the electrical components to the hotend. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/809f991b-b64a-46eb-bc87-5248a2eb747f" width="600"/>

There will be a small hole in the block right above the nozzle of the hotend. This is where the thermistor will be inserted. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ff5475ce-ca49-4b11-a42a-1a9198113b92" width="400"/>

The thermistor

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/25568316-c5b6-4865-913d-e67e055dda5c" width="200"/>

After installing, run the wire through the channel that is built into the hotend. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db105d7f-f45e-4ee2-8ff4-ba87989831df" width="600"/>

Next put the heater on the front of the block and run the wires through the same channel as the thermistor. Secure it and the thermistor in place with the metal clip. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/816ab2e8-2e75-48d0-932d-365b61ea6904" width="600"/>

### Parts Fan
Time to install the parts fan to the front of the hotend heatsink. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/079fcc9f-1a05-4524-a414-5f646b13f125" width="600"/>

Make sure M3 nuts are inserted into these slots of the current assembly. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31a8047c-203f-441c-9252-5e402a07d6f6" width="400"/>

Using 2 M3x20mm screws on top and 2 M2.5x12mm screws on bottom to secure the hotend fan.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70b28acb-eb0b-44fb-b51b-6c837fdbb7d0" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6b1fe6c-5bd6-4c34-ac04-bad08b512f06" width="384"/>

### X Gantry
Start off building the X Gantry by lining up the idlers with the indicated holes and securing in place with 2 M3x20 Hex Screws.
<img src="(https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e96993ae-0902-4b96-b806-d7710f0146ad" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/514bbd8f-24d2-4797-9810-8d411b986082" width="600"/>

Your gantry should now look like this. The yellow boxes indicated where the gantry will be attached to a pair of linear rails. You will need 8 M2x6 Hex Screws in total, 4 for each linear rail. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce6b942d-3be2-42fb-a343-3d55f489169e" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/af106214-e4c4-4e9e-b750-12450851296f" width="600"/>

Here's what it should look like with the rails attached. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c467dfec-9481-4607-829e-a9c057e60abd" width="600"/>

### Combining Axes
Now we can combine both the X and Y gantry. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473fdab5-2522-43b9-8af5-a2f951ea1a42" width="600"/>

First attach the linear rail of the Y axis to the X gantry as shown below, using 4 M2x8mm and 4 M2 Nuts. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/21deac05-1ee3-4488-a921-4ea1e36e1021" width="600"/>

Then attach the (component) on the other side of the Y axis in the same manner. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2a9f8729-0ef7-4b5c-a443-c390910b8b3d" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf06334-0604-49fc-b51e-eb4bf63ff3b6" width="600"/>

### Belts
>[!NOTE]
>When installing the belts, try to get them as tight as possible when you first install them. This will make it easier to get the right tension later.
 
Now we will run the belts for the X and Y axes. Start by running the belt through the Y stop, teeth facing toward the idler, and securing the first 3 teeth into the Y gantry. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca81bfab-3e5d-486d-b96a-9b9ca5ce695f" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3ed59ce1-2239-4a49-995e-2eba90a14c45" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9fc91996-f9ca-4c6b-aebe-649cc2ac882f" width="280"/>

Next we'll be installing the Y motor onto the X gantry. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6c5f6aa5-57dd-4189-9924-8caff77a258f" width="600"/>

Install the pulley onto the axel, making sure one of the set is on the flat face of the axel.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/579fe1b6-f6c7-4411-b6df-45b265518b7c" width="220"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/071f58c6-990e-44a0-ba01-6ac72f8bc03d" width="400"/>

Next install the motor onto the X gantry in the position that is closest to the hotend. Use 4 M2.5x8mm screws.  

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e293f010-29ba-4cc2-8273-37c5731d21a3" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0f9cdb4-9569-489d-b069-4c3259ad0b1a" width="600"/>

Next run the belt through the X gantry and around the pulley. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/091e5ef2-aa74-447c-a5ac-95f2abefe222" width="600"/>

Cut the belt so that it fits into the remaining teeth and then secure in place with a zip tie. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53127ae-119e-4037-a419-d7ed17b72d23" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/28f8cf35-d81d-4924-b71d-981dca9f7f46" width="300"/>

Now we will do the belt for the X axis. Start by running the belt as seen below, going through the lower hole on the right. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/184d2fd3-e540-48bd-bcb0-10c5ce702727" width="600"/>

This next step is tricking and may take several tries to get it just right. Loop the belt around the outside, through the second hole, and then interlock the teeth and pull till it is firmly locked into the first hole. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5b1eb4da-ea42-4e53-a3b7-333254c69d3e" width="400"/>

Next, push the belt to make space for the pulley on the X axis motor (prepared identically to the Y axis motor). 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7cc1e6fb-92ca-4021-b8f4-b606b99887a3" width="600"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ce775bd0-d561-49ab-b603-137e55a0fcb3" width="600"/>

Using a M3x20(?) screw, attach the X belt tensioner on the left side of the assembly. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/386532a5-c28e-4e81-bea2-51252f9848a4" width="600"/>

Run the belt through the bottom slot and then through the top slot like so, securing with a zip tie. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7c3b5091-44cc-45f8-96d3-13e6a8b740d3" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e283ef4-9fca-458f-991e-3b69365d3373" width="400"/>

Next insert a M3x10mm screw and M3 Nut to the hole in the top of the tensioner. This can be used to adjust the belt tension as needed. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a6945aa1-3e4d-4695-9ad6-9b68a0750fe7" width="400"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dfd4188-40bb-49b2-b5ca-bff99d1595fa" width="380"/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12b3c39f-a960-44a5-bc6e-b6b34ff3f06d" width="400"/>

### Hotbed
Next up is assemblying the hotbed. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/68541709-a9e4-49b4-adad-854df8226e4b" width="600"/>

Stick the heating pad onto the metal component like so.
>[!CAUTION]
>Make sure you stick the pad onto the correct side. There should be no indents around the holes for the screw heads. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbd421c4-3ead-4061-8cbd-e0d473481145" width="400"/>

Next use 3 M3x10mm to "attach" the metal bed to the printed holder. Use 3 M3 Nuts on each screw as spacers. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/591c3b34-babb-4eeb-850f-39108be2516c" width="400"/>

The bed will fit into the base like so.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c6ccaba-0652-40a8-a365-d0bc667e1c3d" width="400"/>

### Wiring
Finally it's time to wire all the components to the board. 
>[!NOTE]
>This hole located on the right of the screen holder is where all wires from the outside of the base should be routed through. This includes the X and Y motors, both fans, the thermistor, and heater. <br>
><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12361468-ed2c-4448-af0b-ff4cae994208" width="400"/>

>[!TIP]
>Wire management can be difficult and can take some practice to get good at. The most important thing is making sure the wires are easily identifiable and are not in the way of any moving components. 

We can start with plugging in the motors. There will be 5 (slots) on the side of the board closest to the screen. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44517b25-4dcd-4e2f-b78d-2425e41cd173" width="400"/>

From left to right we have the X motor, Y motor, Z motor, and Extruder. At this time you should also install the 3 red jumpers pictured in the bottom right. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eefe581-1154-454e-9599-c97d1fa577c8" width="400"/>

Next both the fans can be plugged in. The hotend fan is shown with blue and green wires, while the parts fan is shown with red and black. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5853aa3d-db09-489a-88de-4ab71fc61c9f" width="400"/>

The hotend wires can be screwed into the (thing) located right next to them. The orientation of these 2 wires is not important. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5976f16-fded-4f93-94f4-ca0aa67c6ba7" width="400"/>

Both thermistors can be plugged in on the opposite side of the board. The hotend thermistor is shown with blue and green wires, while the bed thermistor has red and black. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d822a788-b5ca-4527-b237-6f86a388fbf8" width="400"/>

The bed wires can be installed in the (thing) right next to where we installed the hotend. Similary, orientation doesn't matter. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f50b4003-296f-44fe-8f27-cf78830ddc88" width="400"/>

The screen can be plugged into the freestanding pins located above the jumpers. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2689e484-922c-4ec5-a81e-77556d32ac77" width="400"/>

### Print Belt
Now that all the insides are done we can do final assembly on the belt. This is straightfoward, but can be tricky to make everything fit right.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/448e1352-1fc4-4751-bfb9-4a574493e3ce" width="600"/>

Place the hotbed inside the belt, with the plastic prongs facing upwards, slotted into the base. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65515845-0a6a-4b5a-8303-31e7a3c4644e" width="600"/>

Slide the other roller into the belt, maneuver it into the curved slots in the base, and then use the belt tensioners to adjust. 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/829bb469-5317-4144-abcf-f764c36e8209" width="600"/>

### Finished Printer
Just attach the bowden tube from the extruder to the hotend and you have your finished printer!

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de2d04fa-db18-4e3f-96c5-4b7619084896" width="600"/>
